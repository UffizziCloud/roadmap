# Roadmap
Welcome to the public roadmap for Uffizzi, the open-source engine for on-demand test environments! Thank you for your interest in our project .

# Introduction
We believe in building in the open. That's why we created this public roadmap to share our current plans and gather feedback about what features should be supported and how they might be implemented.

# FAQs

**Q:** Is everything on the roadmap?

**A:** No. This roadmap is intended to provide a high-level view of major initiatives. It may not include smaller features, and it is not intended to track bugs. Bug issues should be opened in their respective repositories:

* [Uffizzi App](https://github.com/UffizziCloud/uffizzi_app/issues/new)
* [Uffizzi Controller](https://github.com/UffizziCloud/uffizzi_controller/issues/new)
* [Uffizzi CLI](https://github.com/UffizziCloud/uffizzi_cli/issues/new)

**Q:** What do the roadmap categories mean?
* Shipped - Hopefully you are enjoying it! Give us feedback on how it is working!
* Almost There - We are applying the finishing touches. Things in this bucket you can expect to be shipped within 2-4 weeks. 
* We're Writing the Code - Actively in development, we are trying to get this out to you in a good state as soon as we can.
* Investigating - We're thinking about it. This might mean we're still designing, or thinking through how this might work. This is a great phase to send how you want to see something implemented! We'd love to see your usecase or design ideas here.

**Q:** Why are there no dates on your roadmap?

**A:** Because we know things change and we want the room to do the right thing by fixing security issues as they come up or helping people out where they need. This means we might have to change our priorities and donâ€™t want to let people down. 

**Q:** How can I provide feedback or ask for more information?

**A:** Please open an issue in this repo! If the issue is a bug or security issue, please follow the separate instructions above.

**Q:** How can I request a feature be added to the roadmap?

**A:** Please open an issue! You can read about how to contribute [here](https://github.com/UffizziCloud/roadmap/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Community submitted issues will be tagged "Proposed" and will be reviewed by the team.

**Q:** Will you accept a pull request?

**A:** Not on this roadmap repository. If you want to suggest a feature, follow the contributing guidelines linked above. If you would like to contribute to Uffizzi itself, please open a pull request in the appropriate repository.
